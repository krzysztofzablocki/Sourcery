# Sourcery CHANGELOG

---
## 0.5.3

### New Features
- Added support for method return types with `throws` and `rethrows`
- Added a new filter `replace`. Usage: `{{ name|replace:"substring","replacement" }}` - replaces occurrences of `substring` with `replacement` in `name` (case sensitive)
- Improved support for inferring types of variables with initial values
- Sourcery is now bundling a set of example templates, you can access them in Templates folder.
- We now use parallel parsing and cache source artifacts. This leads to massive performance improvements:
- e.g. on big codebase of over 300 swift files:
```
Sourcery 0.5.2
Processing time 8.69941002130508 seconds

Sourcery 0.5.3
First time 4.69904798269272 seconds
Subsequent time: 0.882099032402039 seconds
```

### Bug Fixes
- Method `accessLevel` was not exposed as string so not accessible properly via templates, fixed that.
- Fixes on Swift Templates

## 0.5.2

### New Features

- Added support for `ImplicitlyUnwrappedOptional`
- `actualTypeName` property of `Method.Parameter`, `Variable`, `Enum.Case.AssociatedValue`, `TupleType.Element` now returns `typeName` if type is not a type alias
- `Enum` now contains type information for its raw value type. `rawType` now return `Type` object, `rawTypeName` returns its `TypeName`
- Added `annotated` filter to filter by annotations
- Added negative filters counterparts
- Added support for attributes, i.e. `@escaping`
- Experimental support for Swift Templates

- Swift Templates are now supported

```
<% for type in types.classes { %>
    extension <%= type.name %>: Equatable {}

    <% if type.annotations["showComment"] != nil { %> // <%= type.name %> has Annotations <% } %>

        func == (lhs: <%= type.name %>, rhs: <%= type.name %>) -> Bool {
    <% for variable in type.variables { %> if lhs.<%= variable.name %> != rhs.<%= variable.name %> { return false }
        <% } %>
        return true
    }
<% } %>
```

### 0.5.1

### New Features
- Variables with default initializer are now supported, e.g. `var variable = Type(...)`
- Added support for special escaped names in enum cases e.g. `default` or `for`
- Added support for tuple types and `tuple` filter for variables
- Enum associated values now have `localName` and `externalName` properties.
- Added `actualTypeName` for `TypeName` that is typealias
- Added `implements`, `inherits` and `based` filters

### Bug Fixes
- Using protocols doesn't expose variables using KVC, which meant some of the typeName properties weren't accessible via Templates, we fixed that using Sourcery itself to generate specific functions.
- Fixed parsing typealiases for tuples and closure types
- Fixed parsing associated values of generic types

### Internal Changes
- Performed significant refactoring and simplified mutations in parsers

## 0.5.0
- You can now pass arbitrary values to templates with `--args` argument.
- Added `open` access level
- Type `inherits` and `implements` now allow you to access full type information, not just name
- Type `allVariables` will now include all variables, including those inherited from supertype and known protocols.
- Type `allMethods` will now include all methods, including those inherited from supertype and known protocols.
- AssociatedValue exposes `unwrappedTypeName`, `isOptional`
- New Available stencil filters:
  - `static`, `instance`, `computed`, `stored` for Variables
  - `enum`, `class`, `struct`, `protocol` for Types
  - `class`, `initializer`, `static`, `instance` for Methods
  - `count` for Arrays, this is used when chaining arrays with filters where Stencil wouldn't allow us to do `.count`, e.g. `{{ variables|instance|count }}`
- Now you can avoid inferring unknown protocols as enum raw types by adding conformance in extension (instead of `enum Foo: Equatable {}` do `enum Foo {}; extension Foo: Equatable {}`)

### Internal changes
- Refactor code around typenames

## 0.4.9

### New Features
- Watch mode now works with folders, reacting to source-code changes and adding templates/source files.
- When using watch mode, status info will be displayed in the generated code so that you don't need to look at console at all.
- You can now access types of enum's associated values
- You can now access type's `methods` and `initializers`

## 0.4.8

### New Features
- You can now access `supertype` of a class
- Associated values will now automatically use idx as name if no name is provided

### Bug Fixes
- Fix dealing with multibyte characters
- `types.implementing` and `types.based` should include protocols that are based on other protocols

### Internal changes
- TDD Development is now easier thanks to Diffable results, no longer we need to scan wall of text on failures, instead we see exactly what's different.

## 0.4.7

### New Features
- Added `contains`, `hasPrefix`, `hasPrefix` filters

### Bug Fixes
- AccessLevel is now stored as string

## 0.4.6

### Bug Fixes
- Typealiases parsing could cause crash, implemented a workaround for that until we can find a little more reliable solution

## 0.4.5

### New Features

* Swift Package Manager support.

## 0.4.4

### New Features

* Enum cases also have annotation support

### Internal changes

* Improved handling of global and local typealiases.

* Add upperFirst stencil filter

## 0.4.2
