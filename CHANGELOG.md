- Add support for testing via `SPM`
- Updted SwiftLint, Quick and Nible to latest versions

## 1.3.4
## Fixes
- `isClosure` / `isArray` / `isTuple` / `isDictionary` should now consistently report correct values, this code broke in few cases in 1.3.2
- Trivia (comments etc) will be ignored when parsing attribute description

## 1.3.3
## Fixes
- Fixes information being lost when extending unknown type more than once
- Multiple configuration files can be now passed through command line arguments

## Templates
- AutoEquatable will use type.accessLevel for it's function, closes #675
## Internal changes
- If you are using `.swifttemplate` in your configuration you might notice performance degradation, this is due to new composer added in `1.3.2` that can create memory graph cycles between AST with which our current persistence doesn't deal properly, to workaround this we need to perform additional work for storing copy of parsed AST and compose it later on when running SwiftTemplates. This will be fixed in future release when AST changes are brought in, if you notice too much of a performance drop you can just switch to `1.3.1`.  

## 1.3.2
## New Features
- Configuration file now supports multiple configurations at once

## Fixes
- When resolving extensions inherit their access level for methods/subscripts/variables and sub-types fixes #910
- When resolving Parent.ChildGenericType<Type> properly parses generic information

## Internal changes
- Faster composing phase

## 1.3.1
## Internal changes
- SwiftSyntax dylib is now bundled with the binary

## 1.3.0
## Internal changes
- Sourcery is now using SwiftSyntax not SourceKit
- Performance is significantly improved
- Memory usage for common case (cached) is drastically lowered
- If you want to use Sourcery as framework you'll need to use SPM integration since SwiftSyntax doesn't have Podspec

## Configuration changes
- added `logAST` that will cause AST warnings and errors to be logged, default `false`
- added `logBenchmarks` that will cause benchmark informations to be logged, default `false`

## AST Data Changes
- initializers are now considered as static method not instance
- typealiases and protocol compositions now provide proper `accessLevel`
- if a tuple arguments are unnamed their `name` will be automatically set to index
- default `accessLevel` when not provided in code is internal everywhere
- Added `modifiers` to everything that had `attributes` and split them across, in sync with Swift naming
- block annotations will be applied to associated values that are inside them
- extensions of unknown types will not have the definition module name added in their `globalName` property. (You can still access it via `module`)
- if you had some weird formatting around syntax declarations (newlines in-between etc) the AST data should be cleaned up rather than trying to reproduce that style
- Imports are now proper types, with additional information
- Protocol now has `genericRequirements`, it will also inherit `associatedType` from it's parent if it's not present
- Single value tuples will be automatically unwrapped when parsing

### Attributes
- Attributes are now of stored in dictionary of arrays `[String: [Attribute]]` since you can have multiple attributes of the same name e.g. `@available`
- Name when not named will be using index same as associated value do e.g. objc(name) will have `0: name` as argument 
- spaces will no longer be replaced with `_`

## 1.2.1

## Internal Changes
Tweaks some warnings into info logs to not generate Xcode warnings

## 1.2.0

### New Features
- `Self` reference is resolved to correct type. [Enchancement Request](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/issues/900)
- Sourcery will now attempt to resolve local type names across modules when it can be done without ambiguity. Previously we only supported fully qualified names. [Enchancement Request](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/issues/899)

## Internal Changes
- Sourcery is now always distributed via SPM, this creates much nicer diffs when using CocoaPods distribution.

## 1.1.1

- Updates StencilSwiftKit to 2.8.0

## 1.1.0

### New Features
- [PR](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/pull/897) Methods, Variables and Subscripts are now uniqued in all accessors:
  - `methods` and `allMethods` 
  - `variables` and `allVariables`
  - `subscripts` and `allSubscripts`
  - New accessor is introduced that doesn't get rid of duplicates `rawMethods`, `rawVariables`, `rawSubscripts`s. 
  - The deduping process works by priority order (highest to lowest):
    - base declaration
    - inheritance
    - protocol conformance
    - extensions

## 1.0.3

### Internal Changes
- updated xcodeproj, Stencil and StencilSwiftKit to newest versions

### Bug fixes
- [Fixes type resolution when using xcode project integration](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/issues/887)
- Matches the behaviour of `allMethods` to `allVariables` by only listing the same method once, even if defined in both base protocol and extended class. You could still walk the inheritance tree if you need to (to get all original methods), but for purpose of majority of codegen this is unneccessary.

## 1.0.2

### Bug fixes
- Fixes an issue when a very complicated variable initialization that contained `.init` call to unrelated case would cause the parser to assume the whole codeblock was a type and that could lead to mistakes in processing and even stack overflows

## 1.0.1

### Internal Changes

- Updated project and CI to Xcode 12.1
- Updated SourceKitten, Commander.

### Bug fixes

- Fix multiline method declarations parsing
- Fix an issue, where "types.implementing.<protocolName>" did not work due to an additional module name.

### New Features

- Added support for associated types (#539)

### Bug fixes

- Disallow protocol compositions from being considered as the `rawType` of an `enum` (#830)

line one
// sourcery:end
```
and

```
// sourcery:file:Generated/Foo.swift

** Breaking **

- @objc attribute now has a `name` argument that contains Objective-C name of attributed declaration
- Type collections `types.based`, `types.implementing` and `types.inheriting` now return non-optional array. If no types found, empty array will be returned.

### 0.5.1

### New Features
- Variables with default initializer are now supported, e.g. `var variable = Type(...)`
- Added support for special escaped names in enum cases e.g. `default` or `for`
- Added support for tuple types and `tuple` filter for variables
- Enum associated values now have `localName` and `externalName` properties.
- Added `actualTypeName` for `TypeName` that is typealias
- Added `implements`, `inherits` and `based` filters

### Bug Fixes
- Using protocols doesn't expose variables using KVC, which meant some of the typeName properties weren't accessible via Templates, we fixed that using Sourcery itself to generate specific functions.
- Fixed parsing typealiases for tuples and closure types
- Fixed parsing associated values of generic types

### Internal Changes
- Performed significant refactoring and simplified mutations in parsers

## 0.5.0
- You can now pass arbitrary values to templates with `--args` argument.
- Added `open` access level
- Type `inherits` and `implements` now allow you to access full type information, not just name
- Type `allVariables` will now include all variables, including those inherited from supertype and known protocols.
- Type `allMethods` will now include all methods, including those inherited from supertype and known protocols.
- AssociatedValue exposes `unwrappedTypeName`, `isOptional`
- New Available stencil filters:
  - `static`, `instance`, `computed`, `stored` for Variables
  - `enum`, `class`, `struct`, `protocol` for Types
  - `class`, `initializer`, `static`, `instance` for Methods
  - `count` for Arrays, this is used when chaining arrays with filters where Stencil wouldn't allow us to do `.count`, e.g. `{{ variables|instance|count }}`
- Now you can avoid inferring unknown protocols as enum raw types by adding conformance in extension (instead of `enum Foo: Equatable {}` do `enum Foo {}; extension Foo: Equatable {}`)

### Internal changes
- Refactor code around typenames

## 0.4.9

### New Features
- Watch mode now works with folders, reacting to source-code changes and adding templates/source files.
- When using watch mode, status info will be displayed in the generated code so that you don't need to look at console at all.
- You can now access types of enum's associated values
- You can now access type's `methods` and `initializers`

## 0.4.8

### New Features
- You can now access `supertype` of a class
- Associated values will now automatically use idx as name if no name is provided

### Bug Fixes
- Fix dealing with multibyte characters
- `types.implementing` and `types.based` should include protocols that are based on other protocols

### Internal changes
- TDD Development is now easier thanks to Diffable results, no longer we need to scan wall of text on failures, instead we see exactly what's different.

## 0.4.7

### New Features
- Added `contains`, `hasPrefix`, `hasPrefix` filters

### Bug Fixes
- AccessLevel is now stored as string

## 0.4.6

### Bug Fixes
- Typealiases parsing could cause crash, implemented a workaround for that until we can find a little more reliable solution

## 0.4.5
