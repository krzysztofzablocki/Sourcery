Wouldn't it be great if we could adjust feeds and configurations of our native apps without having to sit back to Xcode, change code, recompile and navigate back to screen we were at?

One of the basis of building tools that allow us to do just that is the way we observe for data changes, this micro-framework provides you File observers for Local and Remote assets.

This framework provides:

- `FileWatcher.Local` useful for observing local file changes, it can also be used to breach Sandbox env for debug simulator builds and e.g. observe file on the developer desktop (like the demo app does).

- `FileWatcher.Remote` can be used to observe files on the web, it supports both `Etag` headers and `Last-Modified-Date` so you can just put file on Dropbox or real ftp server.
