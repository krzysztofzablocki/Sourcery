**Sourcery** is a code generator for Swift language, built on top of Apple's own SourceKit. It extends the language abstractions to allow you to generate boilerplate code automatically.

It's used in over 8,000 projects on both iOS and macOS and it powers some of the most popular and critically-acclaimed apps you have used. Its massive community adoption was one of the factors that pushed Apple to implement derived Equality and automatic Codable conformance. Sourcery is maintained by a growing community of [contributors](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/graphs/contributors).

Try **Sourcery** for your next project or add it to an existing one -- you'll save a lot of time and be happy you did!

## TL;DR
Sourcery allows you to get rid of repetitive tasks. An example might be implementing `Equatable`, without Sourcery you need to implement stuff like this:

```swift
extension Person: Equatable {
    static func ==(lhs: Person, rhs: Person) -> Bool {
        guard lhs.firstName == rhs.firstName else { return false }
        guard lhs.lastName == rhs.lastName else { return false }
        guard lhs.birthDate == rhs.birthDate else { return false }
        return true
    }
}
``` 

This is trivial code but imagine doing this across ten types. Across fifty. How many structs and classes are in your project? 

Sourcery removes the need to write this code. And if you refactor or add properties, the equality code will be automatically updated for you, eliminating possible human errors. 

Sourcery automation can be applied to many more domains, e.g.

- Equality & Hashing
- Enum cases & Counts
- Lenses
- Mocks & Stubs
- LinuxMain
- Decorators
- JSON coding
- NSCoding and Codable

It's trivial to write new templates to remove boilerplate that is specific to your projects.

## How To Get Started
There are plenty of tutorials for different uses of Sourcery:

- [The Magic of Sourcery](https://www.caseyliss.com/2017/3/31/the-magic-of-sourcery) is a great starting tutorial
- [Generating Swift Code for iOS](https://www.raywenderlich.com/158803/sourcery-tutorial-generating-swift-code-ios) deals with JSON handling code
- [How To Automate Swift Boilerplate with Sourcery](https://atomicrobot.io/blog/sourcery/) generates conversions to dictionaries
- [Codable Enums](https://littlebitesofcocoa.com/318-codable-enums) implements Codable support for Enumerations
- [Building an API client with Sourcery](https://littlebitesofcocoa.com/295-building-an-api-client-with-sourcery-key-value-annotations) builds API client leveraging Sourcery annotations
- [Metaprogramming in Swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukm70Ibk_bY) is a video from CocoaHeads where Krzysztof introduces Sourcery

## Installation

- _Binary form_

    Download the  latest release with the prebuilt binary from [release tab](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/releases/latest). Unzip the archive into the desired destination and run `bin/sourcery`
    
- _[Homebrew](https://brew.sh)_

	`brew install sourcery`


- _[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)_

    Add `pod 'Sourcery'` to your `Podfile` and run `pod update Sourcery`. This will download the latest release binary and will put it in your project's CocoaPods path so you will run it with `$PODS_ROOT/Sourcery/bin/sourcery`


- _[Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint)_

    Run `mint run krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery`. 
	> Note: Constraints of SPM (see below) apply.
    
- _Building from source_

    Download the latest release source code from [the release tab](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/releases/latest) or clone the repository and build Sourcery manually.

    - _Building with Swift Package Manager_

        Run `swift build -c release` in the root folder. This will create a `.build/release` folder and will put the binary there. Move the **whole `.build/release` folder** to your desired destination and run with `path_to_release_folder/sourcery`

        > Note: Swift and JS templates are not supported when building with SPM yet.

    - _Building with Xcode_

        Open `Sourcery.xcworkspace` and build with `Sourcery-Release` scheme. This will create `Sourcery.app` in the Derived Data folder. You can copy it to your desired destination and run with `path_to_sourcery_app/Sourcery.app/Contents/MacOS/Sourcery`

## Documentation

Full documentation for the latest release is available [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/master/docs/index.html).

## Usage

Sourcery is a command line tool; you can either run it manually or in a custom build phase using the following command:

```
$ ./sourcery --sources <sources path> --templates <templates path> --output <output path>
```

> Note: this command differs depending on how you installed Sourcery (see [Installing](#installing))

### Command line options

- `--sources` - Path to a source swift files or directories. You can provide multiple paths using multiple `--sources` option.
- `--templates` - Path to templates. File or Directory. You can provide multiple paths using multiple `--templates` options.
- `--force-parse` - File extensions of Sourcery generated file you want to parse. You can provide multiple extension using multiple `--force-parse` options. (i.e. `file.toparse.swift` will be parsed even if generated by Sourcery if `--force-parse toparse`). Useful when trying to implement a multiple phases generation.
- `--output` [default: current path] - Path to output. File or Directory.
- `--config` [default: current path] - Path to config file. File or Directory. See [Configuration file](#configuration-file).
- `--args` - Additional arguments to pass to templates. Each argument can have an explicit value or will have implicit `true` value. Arguments should be separated with `,` without spaces (i.e. `--args arg1=value,arg2`). Arguments are accessible in templates via `argument.name`
- `--watch` [default: false] - Watch both code and template folders for changes and regenerate automatically.
- `--verbose` [default: false] - Turn on verbose logging
- `--quiet` [default: false] - Turn off any logging, only emit errors
- `--disableCache` [default: false] - Turn off caching of parsed data
- `--prune` [default: false] - Prune empty generated files
- `--version` - Display the current version of Sourcery
- `--help` - Display help information

### Configuration file

Instead of CLI arguments you can use a `.sourcery.yml` configuration file:

```yaml
sources:
  - <sources path>
  - <sources path>
templates:
  - <templates path>
  - <templates path>
force-parse:
  - <string value>
  - <string value>
output:
  <output path>
args:
  <name>: <value>
```
