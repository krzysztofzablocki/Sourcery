## What is Sourcery?
_**Sourcery** scans your source code, applies your personal templates and generates Swift code for you, allowing you to use meta-programming techniques to save time and decrease potential mistakes._

<img src="Resources/icon-128.png">

Using it offers many benefits:

- Write less repetitive code and make it easy to adhere to [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself).
- It allows you to create better code, one that would be hard to maintain without it, e.g. [performing automatic property level difference in tests](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/blob/master/Sourcery/Templates/Diffable.stencil)
- Limits the risk of introducing human error when refactoring.
- Sourcery **doesn't use runtime tricks**, in fact, it allows you to leverage compiler, even more, creating more safety.
- **Immediate feedback:** Sourcery features built-in daemon support, enabling you to write your templates in real-time side-by-side with generated code.

**Sourcery is so meta that it is used to code-generate its boilerplate code**

## Why?

Swift features very limited runtime and no meta-programming features. Which leads our projects to contain boilerplate code.

Sourcery exists to allow Swift developers to stop doing the same thing over and over again while still maintaining strong typing, preventing bugs and leveraging compiler.

Have you ever?

- Had to write equatable/hashable?
- Had to write NSCoding support?
- Had to implement JSON serialization?
- Wanted to use Lenses?

If you did then you probably found yourself writing repetitive code to deal with those scenarios, does this feel right?

Even worse, if you ever add a new property to a type all of those implementations have to be updated, or you will end up with bugs.
In those scenarios usually **compiler will not generate the error for you**, which leads to error prone code.

## Examples

##### Use case: `I want to know how many elements are in each enum`
Template:
```swift
{% for enum in types.enums %}
extension {{ enum.name }} {
  static var count: Int { return {{ enum.cases.count }} }
}
{% endfor %}
```

Result:

```swift
extension AdType {
  static var count: Int { return 2 }
}

...
```

----

##### Use case: `I want to generate Equality for types implementing AutoEquatable.`

Template:

```swift
{% for type in types.implementing.AutoEquatable %}
extension {{ type.name }}: Equatable {}

func == (lhs: {{ type.name }}, rhs: {{ type.name }}) -> Bool {
    {% for variable in type.storedVariables %} if lhs.{{ variable.name }} != rhs.{{ variable.name }} { return false }
    {% endfor %}
    return true
}
{% endfor %}
```

Result:
```swift
extension AccountSectionConfiguration: Equatable {}

func == (lhs: AccountSectionConfiguration, rhs: AccountSectionConfiguration) -> Bool {
     if lhs.status != rhs.status { return false }
     if lhs.user != rhs.user { return false }
     if lhs.entitlements != rhs.entitlements { return false }

    return true
}
...
```

##### Use case: `I want to create lenses for all structs.`
_[Full implementation](http://gist.github.com/FilipZawada/934397bbef58e529762aff571a59d9b0)_

Template:

```stencil
{% for type in types.structs %}
extension {{ type.name }} {
{% for variable in type.variables %}
  static let {{ variable.name }}Lens = Lens<{{type.name}}, {{variable.type}}>(
    get: { $0.{{variable.name}} },
    set: { {{variable.name}}, {{type.name | lowercase}} in
       {{type.name}}({% for argument in type.variables %}{{argument.name}}: {% if variable.name == argument.name %}{{variable.name}}{% else %}{{type.name || lowercase}}.{{argument.name}}{% endif %}{% if not forloop.last%}, {% endif %}{% endfor %})
    }
  ){% endfor %}
}
{% endfor %}
```

Result:
```swift

extension House {

  static let addressLens = Lens<House, String>(
    get: { $0.address },
    set: { address, house in
       House(rooms: house.rooms, address: address, size: house.size)
    }
  )

  ...
}
```

## Writing templates
*Sourcery templates are powered by [Stencil](https://github.com/kylef/Stencil)*

Make sure you leverage Sourcery built-in daemon to make writing templates a pleasure:
you can open template side-by-side with generated code and see it change live.

There are multiple ways to access your types:

- `type.TypeName` => access specific type by name
- `types.all` => all types, excluding protocols
- `types.classes`
- `types.structs`
- `types.enums`
- `types.protocols` => lists all protocols (that were defined in the project)
- `types.inheriting.BaseClass` => lists all types inherting from known BaseClass (only those that were defined in source code that Sourcery scanned)
- `types.implementing.Protocol` => lists all types conforming to given Protocol (only those that were defined in source code that Sourcery scanned)
- `types.based.BaseClassOrProtocol` => lists all types implementing or inheriting from `BaseClassOrProtocol` (all type names encountered, even those that Sourcery didn't scan)

For each type you can access following properties:

- `name` <- name
- `kind` <- convience accessor that will contain one of `enum`, `class`, `struct`, `protocol`, it will also provide `extension` for types that are unknown to us(e.g. 3rd party or objc), but had extension in the project
- `isGeneric` <- info whether the type is generic
- `localName` <- name within parent scope
- `variables` <- list of all variables defined in this type, excluding variables from protocols or inheritance
  - if you want to access all available variables, including those from inherited / protocol, then use `allVariables`
  - if you want to accces computed, stored, instance, or static variables, you can do so using our [custom filters](#custom-stencil-tags-and-filter) on both `variables` and `allVariables`
- `methods` <- list of all methods
- `initializers` <- list of all initializers
- `inherits.BaseClass` => info whether type inherits from known base class
- `implements.Protocol` => info whether type implements known protocol
- `based.BaseClassOrProtocol` => info whether type implements or inherits from `BaseClassOrProtocol` (all type names encountered, even those that Sourcery didn't scan)
- `containedTypes` <- list of types contained within this type
- `parentName` <- list of parent type (for contained ones)
- `annotations` <- dictionary with configured [annotations](#source-annotations)

**Enum** types builts on top of regular types and adds:

- `rawType` <- enum raw type
- `cases` <- list of `Enum.Case`
- `hasAssociatedValues` <- true if any of cases has associated values

**Enum.Case** provides:

- `name` <- name
- `rawValue` <- raw value
- `associatedValues` <- list of `AssociatedValue`
- `annotations` <- dictionary with configured [annotations](#source-annotations)

**Enum.Case.AssociatedValue** provides:

- `name` <- name
- `typeName` <- name of type of associated value

**Variable** provides:

- `name` <- Name
- `type` <- type of the variable, if known
- `typeName` <- returns name of the type, including things like optional markup
- `unwrappedTypeName` <- returns name of the type, unwrapping the optional e.g. for variable with type `Int?` this would return `Int`
- `isOptional` <- whether is optional
- `isComputed` <- whether is computed
- `isStatic` <- whether is static variable
- `readAccess` <- what is the protection access for reading?
- `writeAccess` <- what is the protection access for writing?
- `annotations` <- dictionary with configured [annotations](#source-annotations)

**Method** provides:

- `selectorName` <- full name of the method, i.e for `func foo(bar: Bar) -> Bar` `foo(bar:)`
- `shortName` <- short method name, i.e. for `func foo(bar: Bar) -> Bar` `foo`
- `parameters` <- list of all method parameters
- `returnType` <- return type, if known, for initializers - containing type
- `returnTypeName` <- return type name, including things like optional markup. Will be `Void` for methods without return value or empty string for initializers.
- `unwrappedReturnTypeName` <- name of return type, unwrapping the optional e.g. for return type `Int?` this would return `Int`
- `isOptionalReturnType` <- whether return type is optional, `true` for failable initializers
- `accessLevel` <- method access level
- `isStatic` <- whether method is static
- `isClass` <- whether method is class (can be overriden by subclasses)
- `isInitializer` <- whether method is an initializer
- `isFailableInitializer` <- whether method is failable initializer
- `annotations` <- dictionary with configured [annotations](#source-annotations)

**Method.Parameter** provides:

- `name` <- parameter name
- `argumentLabel` <- argument label (external name), if not set will be eqal to `name`
- `type` <- type of parameter, if known
- `typeName` <- parameter type name, including things like optional markup
- `unwrappedTypeName` <- name of the type, unwrapping the optional e.g. for parameter with type `Int?` this would return `Int`
- `isOptional` <- whether is optional

### Custom Stencil tags and filter

- `{{ name|upperFirst }}` - makes first letter in `name` uppercase
- `{% if name|contains: "Foo" %}` - check if `name` contains arbitrary substring
- `{% if name|hasPrefix: "Foo" %}`- check if `name` starts with arbitrary substring
- `{% if name|hasSuffix: "Foo" %}`- check if `name` ends with arbitrary substring
- `static`, `instance`, `computed`, `stored` - can be used on Variable[s] as filter e.g. `{% for var in variables|instance %}`
- `enum`, `class`, `struct`, `protocol` - can be used for Type[s] as filter
- `count` - can be used to get count of filtered array
-
### Using Source Annotations

Sourcery supports annotating your classes and variables with special annotations, similar how attributes work in Rust / Java

```swift
/// sourcery: skipPersistence
/// Some documentation comment
/// sourcery: anotherAnnotation = 232, yetAnotherAnnotation = "value"
/// Documentation
var precomputedHash: Int
```

If you want to attribute multiple items with same attributes, you can use section annotations:
```swift
/// sourcery:begin: skipEquality, skipPersistence
  var firstVariable: Int
  var secondVariable: Int
/// sourcery:end
```

#### Rules:

- Multiple annotations can occur on the same line
- You can add multiline annotations
- You can interleave annotations with documentation
- Sourcery scans all `sourcery:` annotations in the given comment block above the source until first non-comment/doc line

#### Format:

- simple entry, e.g. `sourcery: skipPersistence`
- key = number, e.g. `sourcery: another = 123`
- key = string, e.g. `sourcery: jsonKey = "json_key"`

#### Accessing in templates:

```swift
{% ifnot variable.annotations.skipPersistence %}
  var local{{ variable.name|capitalize }} = json["{{ variable.annotations.jsonKey }}"] as? {{ variable.typeName }}
{% endif %}
```
